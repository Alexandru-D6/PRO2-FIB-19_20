# PRO2-FIB-19_20

This repository contains a set of exercises created for the subject [PRO2](https://www.fib.upc.edu/ca/estudis/graus/grau-en-enginyeria-informatica/pla-destudis/assignatures/PRO2).

All of them were successfully delivered to the platform [Jutge](https://jutge.org/), which is similar to [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/). Unfortunately, not all of the valid test cases are available in this repository.

## Compilation

Some exercises will require additional classes that can be found in the folders [inclusions](/inclusions/) and [objects](/objectes/). You can find more information in the file [setup](/setup.pdf) or inside the subject's web page [Material Docent](https://www.cs.upc.edu/pro2/index.php?id=material-docent).
